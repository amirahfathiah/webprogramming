        <img class="imgr borderedbox inspace-5" src="original.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause of dementia. The word dementia describes a set of symptoms that can include memory loss and difficulties with thinking, problem-solving or language. These symptoms occur when the brain is damaged by certain diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease. </p>
        <p>Alzheimer’s disease, named after the doctor who first described it (Alois Alzheimer), is a physical disease that affects the brain. </p>
        <p>During the course of the disease, proteins build up in the brain to form structures called ‘plaques’ and ‘tangles’. This leads to the loss of connections between nerve cells, and eventually to the death of nerve cells and loss of brain tissue.</p>
        <p>People with Alzheimer’s also have a shortage of some important chemicals in their brain. These chemical messengers help to transmit signals around the brain. When there is a shortage of them, the signals are not transmitted as effectively.</p>
        <p>Current treatments for Alzheimer’s disease can help boost the levels of chemical messengers in the brain, which can help with some of the symptoms. Alzheimer’s is a progressive disease. This means that gradually, over time, more parts of the brain are damaged. As this happens, more symptoms develop. They also become more severe.</p>

    <p>The symptoms of Alzheimer's disease worsen over time, although the rate at which the disease progresses varies. On average, a person with Alzheimer's lives four to eight years after diagnosis, but can live as long as 20 years, depending on other factors.Changes in the brain related to Alzheimer's begin years before any signs of the disease. This time period, which can last for years, is referred to as preclinical Alzheimer's disease.</p>
    <p>The stages below provide an overall idea of how abilities change once symptoms appear and should only be used as a general guide. (Dementia is a general term to describe the symptoms of mental decline that accompany Alzheimer’s and other brain diseases.)</p>
    <p>The stages are separated into three categories: <a href="#2">mild Alzheimer's disease</a>, <a href="#3">moderate Alzheimer's disease</a> and <a href="#4">severe Alzheimer's disease</a>. Be aware that it may be difficult to place a person with Alzheimer's in a specific stage as stages may overlap.</p>

      <p>In the early stage of Alzheimer's, a person may function independently. He or she may still drive, work and be part of social activities. Despite this, the person may feel as if he or she is having memory lapses, such as forgetting familiar words or the location of everyday objects.</p>
      <p>Friends, family or others close to the individual begin to notice difficulties. During a detailed medical interview, doctors may be able to detect problems in memory or concentration. Common difficulties include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Problems coming up with the right word or name</li>
        <li>Trouble remembering names when introduced to new people</li>
        <li>Challenges performing tasks in social or work settings.</li>
        <li>Forgetting material that one has just read</li>
        <li>Losing or misplacing a valuable object</li>
        <li>Increasing trouble with planning or organizing</li>
      </ul>

    <p>Moderate Alzheimer's is typically the longest stage and can last for many years. As the disease progresses, the person with Alzheimer's will require a greater level of care.</p>
    <p>During the moderate stage of Alzheimer’s, the dementia symptoms are more pronounced. A person may have greater difficulty performing tasks, such as paying bills, but they may still remember significant details about their life.</p>
    <p>You may notice the person with Alzheimer's confusing words, getting frustrated or angry, or acting in unexpected ways, such as refusing to bathe. Damage to nerve cells in the brain can make it difficult to express thoughts and perform routine tasks.</p>
    <p>At this point, symptoms will be noticeable to others and may include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Forgetfulness of events or about one's own personal history</li>
      <li>Feeling moody or withdrawn, especially in socially or mentally challenging situations</li>
      <li>Being unable to recall their own address or telephone number or the high school or college from which they graduated</li>
      <li>Confusion about where they are or what day it is</li>
      <li>The need for help choosing proper clothing for the season or the occasion</li>
      <li>Trouble controlling bladder and bowels in some individuals</li>
      <li>Changes in sleep patterns, such as sleeping during the day and becoming restless at night</li>
      <li>An increased risk of wandering and becoming lost</li>
      <li>Personality and behavioral changes, including suspiciousness and delusions or compulsive, repetitive behavior like hand-wringing or tissue shredding</li>
    </ul>

      <p>In the final stage of this disease, dementia symptoms are severe. Individuals lose the ability to respond to their environment, to carry on a conversation and, eventually, to control movement. They may still say words or phrases, but communicating pain becomes difficult. As memory and cognitive skills continue to worsen, significant personality changes may take place and individuals need extensive help with daily activities.</p>
      <p>At this stage, individuals may:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Need round-the-clock assistance with daily activities and personal care</li>
        <li>Lose awareness of recent experiences as well as of their surroundings</li>
        <li>Experience changes in physical abilities, including the ability to walk, sit and, eventually, swallow</li>
        <li>Have increasing difficulty communicating</li>
        <li>Become vulnerable to infections, especially pneumonia</li>
      </ul>

      <center><h4>Numbers of people with dementia</h4></center>
      <br>
      <p>Someone in the world develops dementia every 3 seconds. There were an estimated 46.8 million people worldwide living with dementia in 2015 and this number is believed to be close to 50 million people in 2017. This number will almost double every 20 years, reaching 75 million in 2030 and 131.5 million in 2050. Much of the increase will be in developing countries. Already 58% of people with dementia live in low and middle income countries, but by 2050 this will rise to 68%. The fastest growth in the elderly population is taking place in China, India, and their south Asian and western Pacific neighbours.</p>
      <center><img src="people-with-dementia-increase.png" alt=""></center>
      <p>Demographic ageing is a worldwide process that shows the successes of improved health care over the last century. Many are now living longer and healthier lives and so the world population has a greater proportion of older people. Dementia mainly affects older people, although there is a growing awareness of cases that start before the age of 65.</p>
      <br>
      <p>There are over 9.9 million new cases of dementia each year worldwide, implying one new case every 3.2 seconds.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The World Alzheimer Report 2015 updates ADI's global estimates of the prevalence, incidence and costs of dementia based on systematic reviews. The report makes key recommendations to provide a global framework for action on dementia. The report also includes a review of the evidence for and against recent trends in the prevalence and incidence of dementia over time, as well as an analysis of the broader societal impact of dementia.</p>
